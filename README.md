This is the accompanying raw data to the paper "High-Order Harmonic Generation in Helium: A Comparison Study" by A. T. Bondy, S. Saha, J. C. del Valle, A. Harth, N. Douguet, K. R. Hamilton, and K. Bartschat (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.03677). 

_(From abstract): We report a detailed study of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in helium. When comparing predictions from a single-active-electron model with those from all-electron simulations, such as \ATTOMESA\ and $R$-matrix with time-dependence, which can include different numbers of states in the close-coupling expansion, it seems imperative to generate absolute numbers for the HHG spectrum in a well-defined framework. While qualitative agreement in the overall frequency dependence of the spectrum, including the cut-off frequency predicted by a semi-classical model, can be achieved by many models in arbitrary units, only absolute numbers can be used for benchmark comparisons between different approaches._

Since the underlying quantity is the induced dipole moment, from which all the other parameters (time derivatives, Fourier transforms, spectra in various conventions) can be calculated, we present these data.  To simplify the file structure, all the dipole moments (in a.u.) were interpolated to a common time grid with a step size of 0.1 and are given from the beginning to the end of the driving pulse. The spectra in the paper can be reproduced with sufficient accuracy from these interpolated results.
